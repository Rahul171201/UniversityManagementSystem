# UniversityManagementSystem
**A JAVA FX based DBMS project for university management system**

# Introduction
  An organized and systematic solution is essential for all universities and organizations.There are many departments of administration for the maintenance of college information 
and student databases in any institution. 

# Aim
  All these departments provide various records regarding students. Most of these track records need to maintain information about the students. This information could be the 
general details like student name, address, performance, attendance etc or specific information related to departments like collection of data. All the modules in college administration are **interdependent**. They are maintained manually. So they need to be automated and **centralized** as, information from one module will be needed by other modules.
For example when a student needs his course completion certificate it needs to check many details about the student like his name, registration number, year of study, exams 
he attended and many other details.
